PoE2 Trade Request Helper for Linux | QT6

A little Window that shows incoming trade requests with the item and colorcoded prices to quickly glance if you should react immediately or can let a request sleep for a moment.
I just vibecoded this to be honest. It simply looks at the Client.txt logfile and uses regex to figure out what to show you.
